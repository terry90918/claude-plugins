# PreToolUse guard: block the skip-hooks flag, and block pushes to the default

#
# Why: both are named in the global safety prohibitions. The prohibition text
# stays in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md as well - this hook is the enforcement layer,
# not a replacement for it. A hook only sees the literal Bash command; the
# resident text covers everything the hook cannot see.
#
# Matching is anchored to a real command position (start of line, or after
# ; & | && || ) so that merely MENTIONING a flag inside echo/printf/heredoc
# text is not blocked. An earlier version matched the bare substring and
# denied `echo "... the flag ..."` - it also made this very file impossible
# to edit through Bash. A quoted string that itself looks like a git command
# can still match; removing that residue needs a real shell parser and is not
# worth the complexity.

# Which repository does this command actually act on?
#
# The hook runs in the SESSION's working directory, which is frequently a
# different repository than the one the command targets - `cd <other-repo> &&
# git push ...` and `git -C <path> push ...` are both routine. Evaluating the
# session repo there is simply the wrong question, and it produced false
# denials: pushing a feature branch in repo B was blocked because repo A's
# checkout happened to be sitting on its own default branch. The guard was
# answering "is the session repo on its default branch", not "does this command
# push to a default branch".
#
# Resolution order: an explicit `git -C <path>` wins, then the last `cd <path>`
# that precedes the push on the same line, then the session cwd. Resolution
# never ALLOWS anything on its own - if a named path is missing, unreadable, or
# not a work tree, the check falls back to the session cwd rather than passing.
